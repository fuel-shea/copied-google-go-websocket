# copied-google-go-websocket

This project is a backup/archival for the source code that used to be found at:

    code.google.com/p/go.net/websocket/

## All of this code is verbatim from that URL.

I don't recommend you use it. There are some great Golang websockets libraries out there. This is, at best, an early version of one of them.

I'm just using it because my build process currently requires it. As soon as I can, I'll be fixing that and eliminating this repo.
